The priests of Brahma, like those of the Abracadabranese, are holy and learned men who are never naughty.
%
Brain, n.

    An apparatus with which we think that we think.  That which distinguishes the man who is content to _be_ something from the man who wishes to _do_ something.

The scripture story of the head of John the Baptist on a charger shows that pagan myths have somewhat sophisticated sacred history.

    The time when men of reason go to bed.  Certain old men prefer to rise at about that time, taking a cold bath and a long walk with an empty stomach, and otherwise mortifying the flesh.  They then point with pride to these practices as the cause of their sturdy health and ripe years; the truth being that they are hearty and old, not because of their habits, but in spite of them.  The reason we find only robust persons doing this thing is that it has killed all the others who have tried it.

        A cube of cheese no larger than a die
        May bait the trap to catch a nibbling mie.

    A rich thief.

Koran, n.

Laocoon, n.

    A famous piece of antique sculpture representing a priest of that name and his two sons in the folds of two enormous serpents.

%
Lap, n.

    One of the most important organs of the female system — an admirable provision of nature for the repose of infancy, but chiefly useful in rural festivities to support plates of cold chicken and heads of adult males.  The male of our species has a rudimentary lap, imperfectly developed and in no way contributing to the animal’s substantial welfare.
%
Laureate, adj.

    Crowned with leaves of the laurel.  In England the Poet Laureate is an officer of the sovereign’s court, acting as dancing skeleton at every royal feast and singing-mute at every royal funeral.  Of all incumbents of that high office, Robert Southey had the most notable knack at drugging the Samson of public joy and cutting his hair to the quick; and he had an artistic color-sense which enabled him so to blacken a public grief as to give it the aspect of a national crime.
%
Laurel, n.

    The _laurus_, a vegetable dedicated to Apollo, and formerly defoliated to wreathe the brows of victors and such poets as had influence at court.

Lead, n.

    A heavy blue-gray metal much used in giving stability to light lovers — particularly to those who love not wisely but other men’s wives.  Lead is also of great service as a counterpoise to an argument of such weight that it turns the scale of debate the wrong way.  An interesting fact in the chemistry of international controversy is that at the point of contact of two patriotisms lead is precipitated in great quantities.
%
Learning, n.

    The kind of ignorance distinguishing the studious.
%
Lecturer, n.

    One with his hand in your pocket, his tongue in your ear and his faith in your patience.
%

Leviathan, n.

    An enormous aquatic animal mentioned by Job.  Some suppose it to have been the whale, but that distinguished ichthyologer, Dr. Jordan, of Stanford University, maintains with considerable heat that it was a species of gigantic Tadpole (_Thaddeus Polandensis_) or Polliwig — _Maria pseudo-hirsuta_.  For an exhaustive description and history of the Tadpole consult the famous monograph of Jane Porter, _Thaddeus of Warsaw_.

Liar, n.

    A lawyer with a roving commission.
%
Liberty, n.

    One of Imagination’s most precious possessions.
%
Life, n.

    A spiritual pickle preserving the body from decay.  We live in daily apprehension of its loss; yet when lost it is not missed.

%

    A tall building on the seashore in which the government maintains a lamp and the friend of a politician.

Lord, n.

    In American society, an English tourist above the state of a costermonger, as, Lord ’Aberdasher, Lord Hartisan and so forth.  The traveling Briton of lesser degree is addressed as “Sir,” as, Sir ’Arry Donkiboi, of ’Amstead ’Eath.  The word “Lord” is sometimes used, also, as a title of the Supreme Being; but this is thought to be rather flattery than true reverence.
%
Loss, n.

    Privation of that which we had, or had not.  Thus, in the latter sense, it is said of a defeated candidate that he “lost his election”; and of that eminent man, the poet Gilder, that he has “lost his mind.”  It is in the former and more legitimate sense, that the word is used in the famous epitaph:

        Here Huntington’s ashes long have lain
        Whose loss is our own eternal gain,
        For while he exercised all his powers
        Whatever he gained, the loss was ours.
%
Love, n.

    A temporary insanity curable by marriage or by removal of the patient from the influences under which he incurred the disorder.  This disease, like _caries_ and many other ailments, is prevalent only among civilized races living under artificial conditions; barbarous nations breathing pure air and eating simple food enjoy immunity from its ravages.  It is sometimes fatal, but more frequently to the physician than to the patient.
%

    “Raised” instead of brought up.
%
Luminary, n.

    One who throws light upon a subject; as an editor by not writing about it.

%
Malthusian, adj.

    Pertaining to Malthus and his doctrines.  Malthus believed in artificially limiting population, but found that it could not be done by talking.  One of the most practical exponents of the Malthusian idea was Herod of Judea, though all the famous soldiers have been of the same way of thinking.

Mammalia, n. pl.

    A family of vertebrate animals whose females in a state of nature suckle their young, but when civilized and enlightened put them out to nurse, or use the bottle.

%
Man, n.

    An animal so lost in rapturous contemplation of what he thinks he is as to overlook what he indubitably ought to be.  His chief occupation is extermination of other animals and his own species, which, however, multiplies with such insistent rapidity as to infest the whole habitable earth and Canada.
%
Manes, n.

    A small metal disk given as a reward for virtues, attainments or services more or less authentic.

%
Mind, n.

    A mysterious form of matter secreted by the brain.  Its chief activity consists in the endeavor to ascertain its own nature, the futility of the attempt being due to the fact that it has nothing but itself to know itself with.  From the Latin _mens_, a fact unknown to that honest shoe-seller, who, observing that his learned competitor over the way had displayed the motto “_Mens conscia recti_,” emblazoned his own shop front with the words “Men’s, women’s and children’s conscia recti.”
%
Mine, adj.

    Belonging to me if I can hold or seize it.

    A person engaged in reigning.  Formerly the monarch ruled, as the derivation of the word attests, and as many subjects have had occasion to learn.  In Russia and the Orient the monarch has still a considerable influence in public affairs and in the disposition of the human head, but in western Europe political administration is mostly entrusted to his ministers, he being somewhat preoccupied with reflections relating to the status of his own head.
%

Monosyllabic, adj.

    Composed of words of one syllable, for literary babes who never tire of testifying their delight in the vapid compound by appropriate googoogling.

        The man who writes in Saxon
        Is the man to use an ax on.
      — Judibras

Monsignor, n.

    A high ecclesiastical title, of which the Founder of our religion overlooked the advantages.

Monument, n.

    A structure intended to commemorate something which either needs no commemoration or cannot be commemorated.

        The bones of Agamemnon are a show,
        And ruined is his royal monument,

        but Agamemnon’s fame suffers no diminution in consequence.  The monument custom has its _reductiones ad absurdum_ in monuments “to the unknown dead” — that is to say, monuments to perpetuate the memory of those who have left no memory.
%
Moral, adj.

    Conforming to a local and mutable standard of right.  Having the quality of general expediency.
%
More, adj.

    The comparative degree of too much.

Myrmidon, n.

    A follower of Achilles — particularly when he didn’t lead.

%
Negro, n.

    The _pièce de résistance_ in the American political problem.  Representing him by the letter _n_, the Republicans begin to build their equation thus:  “Let _n_ = the white man.”  This, however, appears to give an unsatisfactory solution.
%

    One whom we are commanded to love as ourselves, and who does all he knows how to make us disobedient.
%
Nepotism, n.

    Appointing your grandmother to office for the good of the party.

%
Nonsense, n.

    The objections that are urged against [the excellent dictionary — _The Devil’s Dictionary_].
%
Nose, n.

    The extreme outpost of the face.  From the circumstance that great conquerors have great noses, Getius, whose writings antedate the age of humor, calls the nose the organ of quell.  It has been observed that one’s nose is never so happy as when thrust into the affairs of another, from which some physiologists have drawn the inference that the nose is devoid of the sense of smell.
%
Notoriety, n.

    The fame of one’s competitor for public honors.  The kind of renown most accessible and acceptable to mediocrity.  A Jacob’s-ladder leading to the vaudeville stage, with angels ascending and descending.
%
Noumenon, n.

    That which exists, as distinguished from that which merely seems to exist, the latter being a phenomenon.  The noumenon is a bit difficult to locate; it can be apprehended only by a process of reasoning — which is a phenomenon.  Nevertheless, the discovery and exposition of noumena offer a rich field for what Lewes calls “the endless variety and excitement of philosophic thought.”  Hurrah (therefore) for the noumenon!
%
November, n.

    The eleventh twelfth of a weariness.
%
Oath, n.

    The popular type and exponent of obstinacy is the mule, a most intelligent animal.
%
Occasional, adj.

    Afflicting us with greater or less frequency.  That, however, is not the sense in which the word is used in the phrase “occasional verses,” which are verses written for an “occasion,” such as an anniversary, a celebration or other event.  True, they afflict us a little worse than other sorts of verse, but their name has no reference to irregular recurrence.
%
Occident, n.

    The part of the world lying west (or east) of the Orient.  It is largely inhabited by Christians, a powerful subtribe of the Hypocrites, whose principal industries are murder and cheating, which they are pleased to call “war” and “commerce.”  These, also, are the principal industries of the Orient.

%
Oleaginous, adj.

    Oily, smooth, sleek.

    Disraeli once described the manner of Bishop Wilberforce as “unctuous, oleaginous, saponaceous.”  And the good prelate was ever afterward known as Soapy Sam.  For every man there is something in the vocabulary that would stick to him like a second skin.  His enemies have only to find it.
%

    Relating to a mountain in Thessaly, once inhabited by gods, now a repository of yellowing newspapers, beer bottles and mutilated sardine cans, attesting the presence of the tourist and his appetite.

%
Once, adv.

    Enough.
%
Opera, n.

    A play representing life in another world, whose inhabitants have no speech but song, no motions but gestures and no postures but attitudes.

    An unlocked door in the prison of Identity.  It leads into the jail yard.

%
Orphan, n.

    A living person whom death has deprived of the power of filial ingratitude — a privation appealing with a particular eloquence to all that is sympathetic in human nature.

It is then instructed in the arts of dependence and servitude and eventually turned loose to prey upon the world as a bootblack or scullery maid.
%
Orthodox, n.

    An ox wearing the popular religious yoke.
%
Orthography, n.

    The science of spelling by the eye instead of the ear.  Advocated with more heat than light by the outmates of every asylum for the insane.  They have had to concede a few things since the time of Chaucer, but are none the less hot in defence of those to be conceded hereafter.
%
Ostrich, n.

    A large bird to which (for its sins, doubtless) nature has denied that hinder toe in which so many pious naturalists have seen a conspicuous evidence of design.  The absence of a good working pair of wings is no defect, for, as has been ingeniously pointed out, the ostrich does not fly.
%
Otherwise, adv.

    No better.
%
Outcome, n.

    A particular type of disappointment.  By the kind of intelligence that sees in an exception a proof of the rule the wisdom of an act is judged by the outcome, the result.  This is immortal nonsense; the wisdom of an act is to be judged by the light that the doer had when he performed it.
%
Outdo, v. t.

    To make an enemy.
%
Out-of-Doors, n.

    That part of one’s environment upon which no government has been able to collect taxes.  Chiefly useful to inspire poets.
%
Ovation, n.

    In ancient Rome, a definite, formal pageant in honor of one who had been disserviceable to the enemies of the nation.  A lesser “triumph.”  In modern English the word is improperly used to signify any loose and spontaneous expression of popular homage to the hero of the hour and place.
%
Overeat, v.

    To dine.
%
Overwork, n.

    A dangerous disorder affecting high public functionaries who want to go fishing.
%
Owe, v.

    To have (and to hold) a debt.  The word formerly signified not indebtedness, but possession; it meant “own,” and in the minds of debtors there is still a good deal of confusion between assets and liabilities.
%
Oyster, n.

    A slimy, gobby shellfish which civilization gives men the hardihood to eat without removing its entrails!  The shells are sometimes given to the poor.

    An uncomfortable frame of mind that may have a physical basis in something that is being done to the body, or may be purely mental, caused by the good fortune of another.
%
Painting, n.

    The art of protecting flat surfaces from the weather and exposing them to the critic.

    Formerly, painting and sculpture were combined in the same work: the ancients painted their statues.  The only present alliance between the two arts is that the modern painter chisels his patrons.
%
Palace, n.

    A fine and costly residence, particularly that of a great official.  The residence of a high dignitary of the Christian Church is called a palace; that of the Founder of his religion was known as a field, or wayside.  There is progress.
%
Palm, n.

    A species of tree having several varieties, of which the familiar “itching palm” (_Palma hominis_) is most widely distributed and sedulously cultivated.  This noble vegetable exudes a kind of invisible gum, which may be detected by applying to the bark a piece of gold or silver.  The metal will adhere with remarkable tenacity.  The fruit of the itching palm is so bitter and unsatisfying that a considerable percentage of it is sometimes given away in what are known as “benefactions.”
%
Palmistry, n.

    The 947th method (according to Mimbleshaw’s classification) of obtaining money by false pretences.  It consists in “reading character” in the wrinkles made by closing the hand.  The pretence is not altogether false; character can really be read very accurately in this way, for the wrinkles in every hand submitted plainly spell the word “dupe.”  The imposture consists in not reading it aloud.
%
Pandemonium, n.

    Literally, the Place of All the Demons.  Most of them have escaped into politics and finance, and the place is now used as a lecture hall by the Audible Reformer.  When disturbed by his voice the ancient echoes clamor appropriate responses most gratifying to his pride of distinction.

What, for example, has been more valorously derided than the doctrine of Infant Respectability?

    It is related of Voltaire that one night he and some traveling companions lodged at a wayside inn.  The surroundings were suggestive, and after supper they agreed to tell robber stories in turn.  When Voltaire’s turn came he said:  “Once there was a Farmer-General of the Revenues.”  Saying nothing more, he was encouraged to continue.  “That,” he said, “is the story.”
%
Rope, n.

    An obsolescent appliance for reminding assassins that they too are mortal.  It is put about the neck and remains in place one’s whole life long.  It has been largely superseded by a more complex electrical device worn upon another part of the person; and this is rapidly giving place to an apparatus known as the preachment.
%
Rostrum, n.

    In Latin, the beak of a bird or the prow of a ship.  In America, a place from which a candidate for office energetically expounds the wisdom, virtue and power of the rabble.

Sacerdotalist, n.

    One who holds the belief that a clergyman is a priest.  Denial of this momentous doctrine is the hardiest challenge that is now flung into the teeth of the Episcopalian church by the Neo-Dictionarians.
%
Sacrament, n.

    A solemn religious ceremony to which several degrees of authority and significance are attached.  Rome has seven sacraments, but the Protestant churches, being less prosperous, feel that they can afford only two, and these of inferior sanctity.  Some of the smaller sects have no sacraments at all — for which mean economy they will indubitably be damned.
%
Sacred, adj.

    Dedicated to some religious purpose; having a divine character; inspiring solemn thoughts or emotions; as, the Dalai Lama of Thibet; the Moogum of M’bwango; the temple of Apes in Ceylon; the Cow in India; the Crocodile, the Cat and the Onion of ancient Egypt; the Mufti of Moosh; the hair of the dog that bit Noah, etc.

    A mechanical device acting automatically to prevent the fall of an elevator, or cage, in case of an accident to the hoisting apparatus.

Saint, n.

    A dead sinner revised and edited.

    The Duchess of Orleans relates that the irreverent old calumniator, Marshal Villeroi, who in his youth had known St. Francis de Sales, said, on hearing him called saint:  “I am delighted to hear that Monsieur de Sales is a saint.  He was fond of saying indelicate things, and used to cheat at cards.  In other respects he was a perfect gentleman, though a fool.”
%
Salacity, n.

    A certain literary quality frequently observed in popular novels, especially in those written by women and young girls, who give it another name and think that in introducing it they are occupying a neglected field of letters and reaping an overlooked harvest.  If they have the misfortune to live long enough they are tormented with a desire to burn their sheaves.
%
Salamander, n.

    Originally a reptile inhabiting fire; later, an anthropomorphous immortal, but still a pyrophile.  Salamanders are now believed to be extinct, the last one of which we have an account having been seen in Carcassonne by the Abbé Belloc, who exorcised it with a bucket of holy water.
%
Sarcophagus, n.

    Among the Greeks a coffin which being made of a certain kind of carnivorous stone, had the peculiar property of devouring the body placed in it.  The sarcophagus known to modern obsequiographers is commonly a product of the carpenter’s art.
%
Satiety, n.

    The feeling that one has for the plate after he has eaten its contents, madam.
%
Satyr, n.

    One of the few characters of the Grecian mythology accorded recognition in the Hebrew.  (Leviticus, xvii, 7.)  The satyr was at first a member of the dissolute community acknowledging a loose allegiance to Dionysus, but underwent many transformations and improvements.  Not infrequently he is confounded with the faun, a later and decenter creation of the Romans, who was less like a man and more like a goat.
%
Sauce, n.

    The one infallible sign of civilization and enlightenment.  A people with no sauces has one thousand vices; a people with one sauce has only nine hundred and ninety-nine.  For every sauce invented and accepted a vice is renounced and forgiven.
%
Scarabæus, n.

    The sacred beetle of the ancient Egyptians, allied to our familiar “tumble-bug.”  It was supposed to symbolize immortality, the fact that God knew why giving it its peculiar sanctity.  Its habit of incubating its eggs in a ball of ordure may also have commended it to the favor of the priesthood, and may some day assure it an equal reverence among ourselves.  True, the American beetle is an inferior beetle, but the American priest is an inferior priest.
%
Scepter, n.

    A king’s staff of office, the sign and symbol of his authority.  It was originally a mace with which the sovereign admonished his jester and vetoed ministerial measures by breaking the bones of their proponents.

Serial, n.

    A literary work, usually a story that is not true, creeping through several issues of a newspaper or magazine.  Frequently appended to each instalment is a “synopsis of preceding chapters” for those who have not read them, but a direr need is a synopsis of succeeding chapters for those who do not intend to read _them_.  A synopsis of the entire work would be still better.
%
Severalty, n.

    Separateness, as, lands in severalty, i.e., lands held individually, not in joint ownership.  Certain tribes of Indians are believed now to be sufficiently civilized to have in severalty the lands that they have hitherto held as tribal organizations, and could not sell to the Whites for waxen beads and potato whiskey.
%
Sheriff, n.

    In America the chief executive officer of a county, whose most characteristic duties, in some of the Western and Southern States, are the catching and hanging of rogues.
%

%
Slang, n.

    The grunt of the human hog (_Pignoramus intolerabilis_) with an audible memory.  The speech of one who utters with his tongue what he thinks with his ear, and feels the pride of a creator in accomplishing the feat of a parrot.  A means (under Providence) of setting up as a wit without a capital of sense.
%
Sophistry, n.

    The controversial method of an opponent, distinguished from one’s own by superior insincerity and fooling.  This method is that of the later Sophists, a Grecian sect of philosophers who began by teaching wisdom, prudence, science, art and, in brief, whatever men ought to know, but lost themselves in a maze of quibbles and a fog of words.
%
Sorcery, n.

    The ancient prototype and forerunner of political influence.  It was, however, deemed less respectable and sometimes was punished by torture and death.  Augustine Nicholas relates that a poor peasant who had been accused of sorcery was put to the torture to compel a confession.  After enduring a few gentle agonies the suffering simpleton admitted his guilt, but naïvely asked his tormentors if it were not possible to be a sorcerer without knowing it.
%
Spooker, n.

    A writer whose imagination concerns itself with supernatural phenomena, especially the doings of spooks.  One of the most illustrious spookers of our time is Mr. William D. Howells, who introduces a well-credentialed reader to as respectable and mannerly a company of spooks as one could wish to meet.  To the terror that invests the chairman of a district school board, the Howells ghost adds something of the mystery enveloping a farmer from another township.
%
Sycophant, n.

    One who approaches Greatness on his belly so that he may not be commanded to turn and be kicked.  He is sometimes an editor.
%
Syllogism, n.

    A logical formula consisting of a major and a minor assumption and an inconsequent.
%
Symbol, n.

    Something that is supposed to typify or stand for something else.  Many symbols are mere “survivals” — things which having no longer any utility continue to exist because we have inherited the tendency to make them; as funereal urns carved on memorial monuments.  They were once real urns holding the ashes of the dead.  We cannot stop making them, but we can give them a name that conceals our helplessness.
%
Symbolic, adj.

    Pertaining to symbols and the use and interpretation of symbols.
%
T.

    T, the twentieth letter of the English alphabet, was by the Greeks absurdly called _tau_.  In the alphabet whence ours comes it had the form of the rude corkscrew of the period, and when it stood alone (which was more than the Phœnicians could always do) signified _Tallegal_, translated by the learned Dr. Brownrigg, “tanglefoot.”
%
Table d’Hôte, n.

    A caterer’s thrifty concession to the universal passion for irresponsibility.

    A scale of taxes on imports, designed to protect the domestic producer against the greed of his consumer.
%
Tedium, n.

    Ennui, the state or condition of one that is bored.  Many fanciful derivations of the word have been affirmed, but so high an authority as Father Jape says that it comes from a very obvious source — the first words of the ancient Latin hymn _Te Deum Laudamus_.  In this apparently natural derivation there is something that saddens.
%
Teetotaler, n.

    One who abstains from strong drink, sometimes totally, sometimes tolerably totally.

Telephone, n.

    An invention of the devil which abrogates some of the advantages of making a disagreeable person keep his distance.

    A device having a relation to the eye similar to that of the telephone to the ear, enabling distant objects to plague us with a multitude of needless details.  Luckily it is unprovided with a bell summoning us to the sacrifice.
%
Tomb, n.

    The House of Indifference.  Tombs are now by common consent invested with a certain sanctity, but when they have been long tenanted it is considered no sin to break them open and rifle them, the famous Egyptologist, Dr. Huggyns, explaining that a tomb may be innocently “glened” as soon as its occupant is done “smellynge,” the soul being then all exhaled.  This reasonable view is now generally accepted by archæologists, whereby the noble science of Curiosity has been greatly dignified.
%
Trichinosis, n.

    The pig’s reply to proponents of porcophagy.
%
Troglodyte, n.

    Specifically, a cave-dweller of the paleolithic period, after the Tree and before the Flat.  A famous community of troglodytes dwelt with David in the Cave of Adullam.

%
Truthful, adj.

    Dumb and illiterate.
%
Turkey, n.

Unction, n.

    An oiling, or greasing.  The rite of extreme unction consists in touching with oil consecrated by a bishop several parts of the body of one engaged in dying.  Marbury relates that after the rite had been administered to a certain wicked English nobleman it was discovered that the oil had not been properly consecrated and no other could be obtained.  When informed of this the sick man said in anger:  “Then I’ll be damned if I die!”

    “My son,” said the priest, “this is what we fear.”
%

    The kind of civility that urban observers ascribe to dwellers in all cities but New York.  Its commonest expression is heard in the words, “I beg your pardon,” and it is not inconsistent with disregard of the rights of others.

%
Wall Street, n.

    A symbol of sin for every devil to rebuke.  That Wall Street is a den of thieves is a belief that serves every unsuccessful thief in place of a hope in Heaven.  Even the great and good Andrew Carnegie has made his profession of faith in the matter.
%
Washingtonian, n.

    A Potomac tribesman who exchanged the privilege of governing himself for the advantage of good government.  In justice to him it should be said that he did not want to.
%
Weaknesses, n. pl.

    Certain primal powers of Tyrant Woman wherewith she holds dominion over the male of her species, binding him to the service of her will and paralyzing his rebellious energies.
%
Weather, n.

    The climate of an hour.  A permanent topic of conversation among persons whom it does not interest, but who have inherited the tendency to chatter about it from naked arboreal ancestors whom it keenly concerned.  The setting up of official weather bureaus and their maintenance in mendacity prove that even governments are accessible to suasion by the rude forefathers of the jungle.
%
Wedding, n.

    A ceremony at which two persons undertake to become one, one undertakes to become nothing, and nothing undertakes to become supportable.
%
Wheat, n.

    A cereal from which a tolerably good whisky can with some difficulty be made, and which is used also for bread.  The French are said to eat more bread _per capita_ of population than any other people, which is natural, for only they know how to make the stuff palatable.

%
Worms’-meat, n.

    The finished product of which we are the raw material.  The contents of the Taj Mahal, the Tombeau Napoleon and the Grantarium.  Worms’-meat is usually outlasted by the structure that houses it, but “this too must pass away.”  Probably the silliest work in which a human being can engage is construction of a tomb for himself.  The solemn purpose cannot dignify, but only accentuates by contrast the foreknown futility.
%
Worship, n.

    Homo Creator’s testimony to the sound construction and fine finish of Deus Creatus.  A popular form of abjection, having an element of pride.
%
Yankee, n.

    In Europe, an American.  In the Northern States of our Union, a New Englander.  In the Southern States the word is unknown.  (See Damyank.)

%
Youth, n.

    The Period of Possibility, when Archimedes finds a fulcrum, Cassandra has a following and seven cities compete for the honor of endowing a living Homer.

Zigzag, v. t.

    To move forward uncertainly, from side to side, as one carrying the white man’s burden.  (From _zed_, _z_, and _jag_, an Icelandic word of unknown meaning.)
%
Zoology, n.

    The science and history of the animal kingdom, including its king, the House Fly (_Musca maledicta_).  The father of Zoölogy was Aristotle, as is universally conceded, but the name of its mother has not come down to us.  Two of the science’s most illustrious expounders were Buffon and Oliver Goldsmith, from both of whom we learn (_L’Histoire générale des animaux_ and _A History of Animated Nature_) that the domestic cow sheds its horns every two years.
